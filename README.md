# NoDrop  
### AI-Powered Student Retention Intelligence  
**Team Codex**

---

## Overview

NoDrop is an AI-driven student dropout risk prediction platform designed to help engineering institutions proactively identify at-risk students and take timely intervention actions.

The system combines machine learning, feature engineering, explainability (SHAP), and institutional analytics into a clean, decision-support dashboard built with Streamlit.

---

## Problem Statement

Many engineering colleges face increasing student dropout rates due to:

- Academic underperformance  
- Attendance issues  
- Financial stress  
- Backlogs accumulation  

Institutions often react too late because they lack predictive insights.

NoDrop solves this by providing:

- Individual student risk prediction  
- Institutional-level risk intelligence  
- AI explainability for transparent decision-making  
- Structured intervention recommendations  

---

## Key Features

### 1. Individual Risk Analysis
- Real-time dropout probability prediction
- Severity classification (Low / Moderate / High Risk)
- AI confidence score
- SHAP-based feature contribution visualization
- Structured intervention recommendations

### 2. Bulk Institutional Intelligence
- CSV upload for batch analysis
- Risk categorization
- Executive summary generation
- Risk distribution visualization
- Top 10 high-risk students identification
- Downloadable full results

### 3. Explainable AI
- SHAP-based decision flow visualization
- Transparent feature impact analysis
- Confidence scoring mechanism

Model Details
Algorithm: XGBoost Classifier
Output: Probability of student dropout
Interpretation: SHAP TreeExplainer
Prediction Type: Binary classification (Dropout vs Continue)
AI Confidence Score
Confidence score is derived from the consistency and magnitude of SHAP value distribution to provide additional interpretability for institutional stakeholders.
